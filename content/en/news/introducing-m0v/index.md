### Target market

Small to medium grid-tied PV systems have become common place. The feed-in-tariffs in various countries over the last many years incentivised installing PV systems. Many were installed without monitoring as it increased the up-front expense. Many of these systems now need upgrades and need to be actively monitored to achieve optimal performance. Monitoring for more recent systems with lower feed-in-tariffs is even more important because downtime due to a fault needs to be minimized to achieve financial viability. 

As the grid becomes more unstable as more renewable sources feed into it and electric vehicles become more prevalent, equipment connected directly to the grid needs better monitoring and pro-active support and maintenance. 

### The Road to 1.0

Easily configurable/usable hardware, software and data platform for monitoring and control of photo-voltaic systems.

The following are the priorities in increasing order of difficulty and time to market:

+ MOV: surge protection device (SPD) status notifier with storage/notification server (2020)
+ MBS: Wired M-Bus (EN1434-3) meter reader with storage/display server  (2020)
+ WMB: Wireless M-Bus meter reader (2021)
+ Modbus inverter communication / control -> with an eye on making something similar to SMA Fuel Save controller (2021) and general appliance control (2021).
+ PLC based module level monitoring -> with an eye on the PV roof tile market (2023).
