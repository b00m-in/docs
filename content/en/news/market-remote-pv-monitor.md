In alphabetical order:

[**Enphase**](https://enphase.com/en-us) sells [Envoy](https://enphase.com/en-us/products-and-services/envoy-and-combiner) which is specifically for use with Enphase microinverters. This device has the advantage of being able to provide panel level information but there are reported noise problems with the PLC based communication between the microinverters and the Envoy. Envoy has the disadvantage of being specific to Enphase microinverters. It's also more expensive than other devices.

[**Thingscloud**](https://thethingscloud.com) sells [ThingsWiFi](https://thethingscloud.com/solar-wifibase-remote-monitoring-sytem.html) which is a WiFi (2.2Ghz only) connected device which connects to inverters and other Modbus-RTU compatible devices.

[**Wattmon**](http://www.wattmon.com/) produces Wattmon Mega/Pro/Mini - a range of Modbus-RTU devices, none of which appear to have any wireless communication capability.

Most inverter manufacturers now have inbuilt monitoring of their own, Delta being the only major exception.
