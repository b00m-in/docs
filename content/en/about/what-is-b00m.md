B00M is an open source remote monitoring device and platform with a focus on [O&M][] of grid tied [PV systems][]. B00M is versatile and can be configured to monitor [ups systems][], [elevators][], [EV charging][] infrastructure, and [weather stations][]. Both the hardware and software are open source and can be freely altered for any requirement.  

The server can be deployed to run on all the major cloud platform providers including [Google Cloud Platform][], [Amazon AWS][], and [Azure][].

## How does B00M work?

A device is available for grid tied PV system installers/operators which is configured to work with B00M's own servers. 

A [Leaderboard][] is publicly available to enable users to compare the performance of their systems against other similar systems.

We share some of our data publicly in [Gridwatch][]

## What Does B00M Do?

B00M uses sensors to monitor a variety of parameters including utility grid parameters, surge protection status, energy import/export and panel level diagnostic parameters. 

## Who Should Use B00M?

B00M is for anybody who wants to make preventative maintenance of assets fun!  

If you dislike emergencies, B00M is for you.
