M0V is an open source remote monitoring device and platform with a focus on [O&M][] of grid tied [PV systems][]. M0V is versatile and can be configured to monitor [ups systems][], [elevators][], [EV charging][] infrastructure, and [weather stations][]. Both the hardware and software are open source and can be freely altered for any requirement.  

The server can be deployed to run on all the major cloud platform providers including [Google Cloud Platform][], [Amazon AWS][], and [Azure][].

## How does M0V work?

A device is available for grid tied PV system installers/operators which is configured to work with M0V's own servers. 

A [Leaderboard][] is publicly available to enable users to compare the performance of their systems against other similar systems.

We share some of our data publicly in [Gridwatch][]

## What Does M0V Do?

M0V uses sensors to monitor a variety of parameters including utility grid parameters, surge protection status, energy import/export and panel level diagnostic parameters. 

## Who Should Use M0V?

M0V is for anybody who wants to make preventative maintenance of assets fun!  

If you dislike emergencies, M0V is for you.
