Nothing like free tools to increase collective productivity. It takes a long time to get good enough to out-grow these simple tools and demand commercially developed ones. 

## Git

This is an absolute necessity for collaborate development. If you haven't heard about or used Git, please read about it and use it one a simple project. 

## Golang

[Golang](https://golang.org) is quite straight-forward to use to accomplish a lot very quickly, but most of us at some point get carried away at how quickly we can bash out a lot of Go code. We're fans of those who can take two steps forward by themselves and then a step back to consider what impact their work has on others and improve the design and documentation to enable others to follow in their footsteps. 

This documentation layout is generated using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io)

## C

C is still the most versatile language for embedded programming / firmware and all B00M device images are built using C and associated tools.

## Kicad / PCB Layout

Kicad is a simple tool for electronic design. It has enough features to develop B00M's devices. 

## Java / Android development

Android is still the device of choice for cost-conscious consumers. 

## LTSpice / Power Electronics design

LTSpice is a powerful tool for simulations of electronic circuit designs.
