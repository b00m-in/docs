If you have any experience in any of the [tools]() and would like to get involved we're always looking to hire new collaborators. We're a remote only team with twice-a-year gatherings in scenic locations.

## Git 

Basic knowledge and experience using Git even on simple projects is desirable. 

## Golang / Java

[Golang](https://golang.org) is quite straight-forward to use to accomplish a lot very quickly, but most of us at some point get carried away at how quickly we can bash out a lot of Go code. We're fans of those who can take two steps forward by themselves and then a step back to consider what impact their work has on others and improve the design and documentation to enable others to follow in their footsteps. 

Hands on experience with Go Modules and some contribution (however trivial) to an open source Golang project is desirable.  

Java/Android is still widely used on mobile so experience with and some contribution (however trivial) to an open source Java project is also desirable. 

## C

If you're comfortable in C, we can collaborate on the firmware. Also if you're keen, learning Golang should be a breeze for C programmers. 

## Electronics

If you have or would like to enhance your skills with Kicad / LTSpice (electronic design and simulation) in general, we'll be able to use your skills and assist you enhancing them.
